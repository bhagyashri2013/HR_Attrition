# HR Employee Attrition Analysis (SQL Project)

## Background
Employee attrition impacts company performance and increases hiring costs.
HR teams need data-driven insights to understand why employees leave.

## Problem Statement
The company was facing high employee attrition but did not know
which departments, salary levels, or experience groups were most affected.

## Analysis Performed
- Calculated total attrition and attrition rate
- Analyzed attrition by department, salary range, experience, and gender
- Used SQL queries with GROUP BY, CASE statements, and aggregate functions

## Solution
Based on the analysis, attrition was higher among low-salary and
early-tenure employees. To reduce attrition, the company should
improve salary structure, support new employees, and focus on
high-attrition departments.
